  # One runtime dependency, on purpose (glass:docs/PROPOSAL.md §7.1, D2): a
  # sampler written in Ruby can only observe a thread once it has released
  # the GVL, so it attributes nearly all time to blocking calls — measured,
  # 99% to `sleep` against a truth of 4%. Vernier samples natively, has no
  # dependencies of its own, and is loaded lazily: if it cannot be loaded the
  # agent runs without profiles rather than not at all.
