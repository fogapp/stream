# FogClient: the app-side view of Fog's federation (fog:docs/federation-proposal.md §8).
#
# Fog injects FOG_API_URL and FOG_API_TOKEN into every app it manages. This
# client wraps that surface: which other Fog instances ("peers") the operator
# has exposed to apps, which apps those peers run and where. The point is
# zero-config discovery — a "select a household" list instead of a URL typed
# over Signal.
#
# Two rules this client enforces by construction:
#
#   1. Inert without Fog. No env vars → `available?` is false, `peers` is
#      [], nothing raises. An app using this gem runs identically outside
#      the fog stack — fog is a convenience, never a dependency.
#   2. Never hurt the host app. Short timeouts, every network failure
#      swallowed into an empty answer. Fog being down costs a feature,
#      never a request.
#
# (Named FogClient, not Fog, to stay clear of the classic `fog` cloud gem.)
