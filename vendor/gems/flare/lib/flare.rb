# Flare: error reporting to Fog's built-in tracker (fog:docs/flare-proposal.md).
#
# The whole client in one sentence: a Rails.error subscriber builds
# Sentry-schema events and a single background thread POSTs them to the
# FLARE_DSN Fog injects — bounded queue, drop on overflow, so reporting can
# never hurt the app doing the reporting. No configuration is required; no
# DSN means the gem is inert (development, test, apps run outside Fog).
#
# Wire-compatible with Sentry on purpose: point the official sentry-ruby SDK
# at the same DSN and the server can't tell the difference.
