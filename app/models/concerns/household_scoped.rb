# Household tenancy (manor:app/models/concerns/household_scoped.rb):
# - default scope filters by Current.household *when set* — a no-op in jobs,
#   console, and seeds so background work sees everything;
# - household_id is always assigned from the authenticated context on create,
#   never from user input.
