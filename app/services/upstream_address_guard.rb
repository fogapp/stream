# Refuses to fetch anything on the machine's own network.
#
# Stream's job is fetching URLs it was handed: an integration an operator
# configured, a provider it looks titles up on, an artwork URL a provider
# introduced, and — the part that matters most — whatever any of those redirect
# to. That is the classic shape of a server-side request forgery: the attacker
# never needs credentials, only a URL Stream will dutifully GET from inside the
# network the browser can't reach.
#
# The addresses below are the ones with nothing legitimate to say to a content
# fetch. 169.254.169.254 is the cloud metadata endpoint on every major
# provider; 127/8 and the RFC 1918 ranges are the fog network, the database,
# the sibling apps, and the router's admin page.
#
# THIS IS NOT A BAN ON PRIVATE ADDRESSES GENERALLY. The sibling apps on the
# fog network (Sonarr, Radarr, Immich, Whisper, a Plex being migrated from)
# are supposed to be on private addresses, and a household points
# Stream at them in Settings (CLAUDE.md: configuration belongs in the UI). Those
# clients opt out explicitly by overriding allow_private_addresses?, with the
# reason written next to it, which is why this is a per-caller decision rather
# than a global rule.
#
# check! returns the vetted address, and UpstreamHttpClient pins the
# connection to it (Net::HTTP#ipaddr=, with the original host kept for
# Host/SNI/verification). That closes the classic rebinding gap — resolve
# here, resolve again inside Net::HTTP, get a different answer — because the
# second resolution never happens: the socket opens to the exact address this
# module approved.
